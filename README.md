# Spatial Hearing VR

This project was a class project built in Unity. This is meant to be a VR application designed for tesing an individuals spatial awareness in terms of sound.

The person being tested is standing in the middle of a circle, surrounded by 360 balloons. They will hear a sound in the VR headsets headphones, and wherever they thought the sound was coming from they'd pop the balloon that was in that space.

The test wasn't really about accuracy - it was more about having a general sense of where the sound was coming from. The sound was originally going to play from a random balloon, but our "customer" (a professor of audiology at our university) wanted us to use a math formula to generate the direction the sound was coming from instead.

### PLEASE NOTE
This code is old and will not work. I would not recommend cloning this project.
